> A small set of adapters extending Rust's error-handling capabilities.

## Option

Rust's [Option](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html) ships with a suite
of combinators meant to ease common tasks requiring handling optionality safely.

This library extends it with a little extra set of capabilities as defined in the `OptionExt<A>` trait.

## Result

Rust's [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html) ships with a suite
of combinators meant to ease common tasks requiring handling failure safely.

This library extends it with a little extra set of capabilities as defined in the `ResultExt<A, E>` trait.
